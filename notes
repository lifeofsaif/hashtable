 JAVA

     constructors have no publics or voids i suppose.... for now... lol.....

     have to declare instance of class within the main function, even though it is in the class....

     ARRAYS
        curly brackets are a quick way to declare new arrays i.e.
            String[] elementsToAdd = {"1", "this doesnt look right"};
        they can also be used to reinit arrays 
            elementsToAdd = new String[] {"fuck", "saif"}

    HASH(MAPS/TABLES)
        HASH TABLES ARE BAD!!!!! WE DO NOT USE THEM IF ITS NOT ALREADY BEING USED
